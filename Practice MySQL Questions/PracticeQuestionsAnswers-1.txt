1- Find all products (product code and product name) which are ordered by customer "Herkku Gifts" on 11/18/2003. 

SELECT p.productCode, p.productName
FROM products p
INNER JOIN orderdetails od ON p.productCode = od.productCode
INNER JOIN orders o ON od.orderNumber = o.orderNumber
INNER JOIN customers c ON o.customerNumber = c.customerNumber
WHERE c.customerName = "Herkku Gifts"
AND o.orderDate = "2003-11-18";



2- For each product list the product code and the total number of orders containing that product. You do not need to list a product if it has not been in any orders.

GROUP BY p.productCode;

INNER JOIN products p ON od.productCode = p.productCode
WHERE p.productName = "2001 Ferrari Enzo"
);

So return a table with product code and the total quantity ordered of that product by customer "Mini Wheels Co." (Your query should return every product even if "Mini Wheels Co." has never ordered that product).

SELECT p.productCode, SUM(quantityOrdered)
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN ( SELECT od.productCode, od.quantityOrdered
		FROM orderdetails od
		INNER JOIN orders o ON od.orderNumber = o.orderNumber
		INNER JOIN customers c ON o.customerNumber = c.customerNumber
		WHERE c.customerName = "Mini Wheels Co.") as tmp
ON tmp.productCode = p.productCode
GROUP BY p.productCode;
